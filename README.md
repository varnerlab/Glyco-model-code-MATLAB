### Introduction
This repository contains model code for the publication:

  [Wayman et al (2019) Improving designer glycan production in Escherichia coli through model-guided metabolic engineering. Metabolic Engineering Communications, to appear.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214030117300160)

### Installation and Requirements
To install the _E.coli_ model, download this repository as a zip file, or `clone`/`pull` it using the command (from the command-line):

    $ git pull https://github.com/varnerlab/Glyco-model-code-MATLAB.git

or

    $ git clone https://github.com/varnerlab/Glyco-model-code-MATLAB.git

The model code is written in the [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) programming language.
The model code requires the [GLPK](https://www.gnu.org/software/glpk/) solver, which can be interfaced with
[MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) using the [GLPKMEX](https://github.com/blegat/glpkmex) bridge.


### Funding
